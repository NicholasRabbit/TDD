# TDD and Unit Test
Being a software developer for nearly three years, there are always some fancy words such as TDD, unit test, etc. reflecting in front of me. Unfortunately, I hadn't learnt how to adopt these patterns or approaches until recently I found myself wasting too much time on testing. Specifically, it is integrate test that cost considerable amount of the precious time. Believe it or not, all of my colleagues haven't write unit test in their project, let alone TDD. We are not able to write robust applications if we struck against endless and time-consuming integrate test.

Whereas, a lot of exceptional programmers who had faced the same problems we have now had already tackle these issues by writing unit tests and, furthermore, adopting TDD. Lessa Koskela is among those prominent  programmers. He wrote such an excellent book for us and I have learned not only  TDD but also practical skills which is beneficial for junior developers. I want to say thank you indeed, Lessa.
